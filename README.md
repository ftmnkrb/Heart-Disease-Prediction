# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to diagnose heart disease. Using a dataset with clinical characteristics such as age, gender, symptoms, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other measurements, we seek to accurately classify whether a person has heart disease.
